excerpt: a running list of articles and annecdoatal evidence that ai isn't providing real productivity boosts
draft: false
---

this list enumerates things that i've happened to glimpse online that suggest that (1) the productivity boosts provided by ai are minimal if not moot and/or (2) *real* companies are backing off the ai bet. i'm keeping this since i feel like i'm between a rock and a hard place: the claims made by these articles are so obvious as to be weather-level banal and yet (and yet) it seems like the c-suite execs are still *so sure* they can squeeze some extra juice utilizing this highly subsidized, ready to bubble burst, technology.

use whenever your boomer boss shows you that article about how engineers at spotify aren't writing code anymore or whatever.
